# MrMechanic

## What it does
The software takes general and non-technical input about a user's car and estimates the costs to repair and the potential issue. The user input includes generally accessible information like temperature, mileage, average speed, etc. The input is then quantified using Gemini AI and then fed into a linear regression model to estimate costs. This feature was implemented to improve user experience and so anybody without technical knowledge of cars can access our software.
